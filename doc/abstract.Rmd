**The metabolic pathways between components of stature and HbA1c: A casual
structure learning approach in the UK Biobank**

Luke W Johnston, Clemens Wittenbecher, Helene V Tilma, Christine D Dahm, Daniel R Witte

**Background and aims**:
Shorter relative adult leg length (LL), a marker of adverse growth conditions
during early childhood, is associated with a higher risk for type 2 diabetes. 
However, how this link is mediated metabolically is not well known in humans.
Our aim was to identify how the components of stature influence the adult
metabolic profile and consequently risk for type 2 diabetes through higher
HbA1c.

**Materials and methods**:
We used 367,838 participants (176,420 men, 191,418 women) from UK Biobank,
excluding prevalent diabetes cases.
We applied a causal structure learning algorithm (NetCoupler)
to identify the most likely causal path between an exposure, 
a metabolic network, and an outcome.
For this study, we used height, LL, and leg-to-height ratio (LHR) as the
exposure and HbA1c as the outcome.
The metabolic variables chosen to form part of the network were:
gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), TAG, LDL, HDL, total cholesterol,
creatinine, creatinine enzyme in urine, C-reative protein (CRP),
apolipoprotein A and B (ApoA, ApoB), and albumin.

**Results**:
There were several strong links identified by the metabolic network 
generated from NetCoupler (Figure).
In particular, it identified the expected grouping between HDL-LDL-Cholesterol-TAG 
(serum lipid profile) and GGT-ALT-AST (liver function). 
Between the network variables and HbA1c, 
there were: positive relationships between ALT, GGT, and CRP;
and, a negative relationship with creatinine.
For the stature components, there were negative relationships between:
LHR, LL, and height on TAG; LHR, LL on CRP and ALT; and, LL and height on GGT.
There were positive relationships between:
LL and height on creatinine; LL on HDL; and, height on creatinine (in urine).
Based on the NetCoupler algorithm, we found that LHR, LL, and Height were
causally linked with HbA1c through GGT, ALT, creatinine, and CRP.

**Conclusion**:
Our findings suggest that overall childhood growth conditions
that result in relatively longer legs and to taller stature may confer some
protection against type 2 diabetes (from higher HbA1c) potentially through:
a better functioning liver (through GGT and ALT);
through generally lower inflammation (via CRP). 
Our finding of the connection between stature 
and its components with higher creatinine (i.e. lower kidney function) and its
link with lower HbA1c is puzzling and may be due to...?
