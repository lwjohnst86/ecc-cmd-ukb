### A1. Project title (200 characters):

The metabolic consequences of adverse early life conditions and subsequent risk
for adult cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes

### A2. Research question(s) and aim(s) (up to 5000 characters or 200 words):

The overarching goal for this project is to better quantify and
understand the impact that early life conditions have on adult metabolic
capacity and the risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease
(CVD) in adulthood. To that aim we have two objectives:

1. To determine the association between early life adversity (e.g. using adult
leg length) and various metabolic characteristics:
    - Estimation of adult liver function 
    - Distribution and location of body fat
    - Estimation of adult kidney function 
    - Adult glycemic and metabolic biomarkers 
    - Polygenic risk scores

2. To quantify the direct and indirect (mediated) associations between exposure
to early life adversity and risk for T2D and CVD, considering adult metabolic
capacity (using all variables listed above).

> The majority of applications to UK Biobank are for data only. As such, the first two questions we ask are whether your application involves access to samples or re-contact as this will require some additional information and as is set out in the Access Procedures (our data are not depletable, but our samples and re-contact opportunities are depletable) recontact/sample applications are assessed to a different (more exacting) standard.

Does your project require biological samples? **No**

Does your project require UK Biobank to re-contact participants: **No**

### A3. The background and scientific rationale of the proposed research project in general (up to 5000 characters or 300 words): 

Words: 300 / 300

Early life adversity is known to increase the risk for chronic cardiometabolic
diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in later
adulthood. Early life, typically defined from conception until early childhood
(~6 years), is a period characterised by substantial growth and development.
Extreme periods of or consistent exposure to adversity, such as poverty,
malnutrition, or famine, can set individuals on a higher disease risk
trajectory. For instance, exposure to famine during early life can increase the
risk of developing T2D by about 60%. While extreme early life adversity is
relatively uncommon in contemporary European populations, some immigrants and
refugees have been exposed to more extreme conditions (e.g. refugees from
conflict-ridden Syria). Even less extreme adversity, such as neglect, loss of a
parent, or childhood conflict, can increase the risk for cardiometabolic
disease. For instance, neglect and emotional abuse can increase the risk of
obesity, a strong predictor of CVD and T2D, by up to 50%. These forms of
adversity are more common in EU countries, with nearly 30% of EU children
experiencing some form of mental or physical abuse.

A crucial step to developing evidenced-based solutions to mitigate risk is in
understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the association
between early life adversity and the development of cardiometabolic disease.
There are limited studies that have investigated this area. A few studies
suggest that lower early life socioeconomic position and other indirect
indicators of early life conditions associates with a lower metabolic capacity.
There is very limited knowledge on how early life adversity mediates its effect
on later disease through adult metabolic capacity (such as through lipid
metabolism, inflammatory processes, and/or glucose regulation). This project's
aim is to investigate potential metabolic changes that result from early life
adversity and the resulting risk for cardiometabolic disease.

### A4. A brief description of the method(s) to be used (up to 5000 characters or 300 words): 

Words: 262 / 300

For objective 1, the outcome variables are the metabolic characteristic
variables and the predictor variables are several markers of early life,
including adult leg length (a biomarker of early childhood conditions). We will
analyse the data in two stages. First, we will run individual regression models
for each of the outcomes and early life factors, adjusted for potential
confounders. The next step will be to run supervised dimensionality reduction
and clustering techniques on the metabolic characteristics, with early life
conditions as the supervising set. These techniques will, together, provide a
broad view of how early life conditions associate with adult metabolic function.

For objective 2, we will use a causal structure learning algorithm to identify
the contributions of individual metabolic variables (using multiple aspects of
metabolic function from the various metabolic measurements) that may mediate the
association between early life adversity and the presence of cardiometabolic
disease in adulthood. The algorithm constructs causal pathways in an iterative
approach, while also taking into account the inherent interdependence of the
metabolic variables. The strengths of this causal structure learning method over
others are a) the ability to make use of high dimensional metabolic data, b) to
estimate the most probable directions and relative strength of the pathways, and
c) to identify the most likely causal structure linking exposure (early life
adversity), metabolic variables, and outcome (CVD or T2D). This approach is
necessary as any analytic approach to the question of mediation must consider
interdependence between potential mediating pathways, in order to quantify the
magnitude of association, and to determine the direction of the pathway.

### A5. The type and size of dataset required (e.g., case-control subset, men only, imaging data only, whole cohort, etc.) (up to 5000 characters or 100 words):

For the most part we need the whole cohort, based on the availability of the
variables requested. Once available, we would like to request the blood measures
(e.g. LDL, HDL, glucose, ALT, AST, etc). We also will require the subset of
participants with the MRI and DXA variables (as included in the basket).

### A6. The expected value of the research (taking into account the public interest requirement) (up to 5000 characters or 100 words): 

Word count: 100 / 100

We expect our results to provide etiological insight into how early life
exposure to adversity modifies adult metabolic capacity, which may subsequently
reveal specific metabolic patterns (e.g. higher serum lipid levels or greater
storage of fat in liver) or a greater fat deposition in abdominal adipose
tissue. These insights could ultimately inform the development of more
individually targeted prevention or management strategies for those exposed to
early life adversity. We also intend to publish the analytic methods in a format
easily usable by other researchers, e.g. as an R (statistical language) package,
which we expect will accelerate further research.

We aim to study how early life adversity influences the risk of heart attacks,
stroke, and diabetes in adulthood. While we know that early life adversity
negatively affects health in later adulthood, we don't know much about the
biological mechanisms responsible. Historically, this area of research has been
difficult to study due to limited availability of suitable data and methods.
Recent advances in analysis methods (machine learning) coupled with the recent
availability of very large cohorts such as the UK Biobank, now allow us to begin
answering how early life conditions influence later adult heart disease and
diabetes risk. Over the course of 48 months, we not only will learn more about
the "how" of early life adversity's role in disease, but also aim to create
better tools for this new type of analyses so other researchers can further
accelerate their own work. In the end, we hope that this knowledge will help
with creating more effective public health strategies for disease prevention and
with making more precise clinical decisions for disease management in those who
experienced early life adversity.

### A9. Will the research project result in the generation of any new data fields derived from existing complex datasets, such as imaging, accelerometry, electrocardiographic, linked healthcare data, etc, which might be of significant utility to other researchers:

*No*

### A10. What is the estimated duration of your project, in months? If you consider (because for example the project is one involving the generation of hypotheses) that it would be difficult to set a fixed end point, we are prepared to consider a rolling 3-year period (during which annual updates are required):

*48 months*

Please note that you are expected to publish (or to make publicly available) your results and return to UK Biobank:

- any important derived variables
- a description of the methods used to generate them
- the underlying syntax/code used to generate the main results of the paper, and
- a short layman's description that summarises your findings.

These should be provided within six months of each publication or within 12 months of the project end date (whichever comes first). We also ask that you send us a copy of your accepted manuscript at least two weeks prior to publication and alert us if there are any ethical or contentious issues surrounding the findings.
