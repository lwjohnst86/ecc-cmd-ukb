### A1. Project title (200 characters):

The metabolic consequences of adverse early life conditions and subsequent risk
for adult cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes

### A2. Research question(s) and aim(s) (up to 5000 characters or 200 words):

The overarching goal for this project is to better quantify and
understand the impact that early life conditions have on adult metabolic
capacity and the risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease
(CVD) in adulthood. To that aim we have two objectives:

1. To determine the association of early childhood adversity (using adult leg
length as a biomarker) on various metabolic characteristics:
    - Adult liver function (using markers of fat and inflammation from MRI
    images).
    - Distribution of body fat, whether fat is stored primarily in the trunk or in
    the peripheral tissues (using DXA and bioimpediance measures).
    - Adult kidney function (using urinary markers).
    - Adult blood biomarkers (fasting glucose, lipid measures) {{confirm with what
    they have measured}}.

2. To determine the mediating pathways that adult metabolic capacity (using all
variables listed above) has between exposure to early childhood adversity and
risk for T2D and CVD.

> The majority of applications to UK Biobank are for data only. As such, the first two questions we ask are whether your application involves access to samples or re-contact as this will require some additional information and as is set out in the Access Procedures (our data are not depletable, but our samples and re-contact opportunities are depletable) recontact/sample applications are assessed to a different (more exacting) standard.

Does your project require biological samples? **No**

Does your project require UK Biobank to re-contact participants: **No**

### A3. The background and scientific rationale of the proposed research project in general (up to 5000 characters or 300 words): 

Early life adversity is known to increase the risk for chronic cardiometabolic
diseases such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in later
adulthood. Early life, typically defined from conception until early childhood
(~6 years), is a period characterised by substantial growth and development.
Extreme periods of or consistent exposure to adversity, such as poverty,
malnutrition, or famine, can set individuals on a higher disease risk
trajectory. For instance, exposure to famine during early life can increase the
risk of developing T2D by about 60%. While extreme early life adversity is
relatively uncommon in contemporary European populations, some immigrants and
refugees have been exposed to more extreme conditions (e.g. refugees from
conflict-ridden Syria). Even less extreme adversity, such as neglect, loss of a
parent, or childhood conflict, can increase the risk for cardiometabolic
disease. For instance, neglect and emotional abuse can increase the risk of
obesity, a strong predictor of CVD and T2D, by up to 50%. These forms of
adversity are much more common in many EU countries, with nearly 30% of EU
children experiencing some form of mental or physical abuse.

A crucial step to developing evidenced-based solutions to mitigate risk is
in understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the association
between early life adversity and the development of cardiometabolic disease.
Limited data exists that have investigated this area. A few studies suggest that
lower early life socioeconomic position and other indirect indicators of early
life conditions associates with a lower metabolic capacity. There
is very limited knowledge on how early life adversity mediates its effect on
later disease through adult metabolic capacity (such as through lipid
metabolism, inflammatory processes, and/or glucose regulation).
This project's aim is to investigate potential metabolic changes that result
from early life adversity and the resulting risk for cardiometabolic disease.

### A4. A brief description of the method(s) to be used (up to 5000 characters or 300 words): 

Words: 223 / 300

For objective 1, we will analyse the data in two stages. First, we will run
individual regression models for each of the variables, adjusted for potential
confounders, with each metabolic variable as the outcome and early life
conditions as the predicters. The next step will be to run supervised
dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques, with early life conditions
as the supervising set. These techniques will, together, provide a broad view of
how early life conditions associate with adult metabolic function.

For objective 2, we will use a causal structure learning algorithm to identify
the contributions of individual metabolic variables (using multiple aspects of
metabolic function from the various metabolic measurements) that may mediate the
association between early life adversity and the development of cardiometabolic
disease. The algorithm constructs causal pathways in an iterative approach,
while also taking into account the inherent interdependence of the metabolic
variables. The strengths of this causal structure learning method over others
are a) the ability to make use of high dimensional metabolic data, b) to
estimate the most probable directions of the pathways, and c) to identify the
most likely causal structure between exposure (early life adversity), metabolic
variables, and outcome (CVD or T2D). This approach is necessary as the method
must consider interdependence between variables, to quantify the magnitude of
association, and to determine the direction of the pathway.

### A5. The type and size of dataset required (e.g., case-control subset, men only, imaging data only, whole cohort, etc.) (up to 5000 characters or 100 words):

Whole cohort, MRI imaging, and the biomarker data.

### A6. The expected value of the research (taking into account the public interest requirement) (up to 5000 characters or 100 words): 

Word count: 103 / 100

We hope our results will provide etiological insight into how early life
exposure to adversity modifies adult metabolic capacity, which may subsequently
reveal specific metabolic patterns (e.g. more circulating lipids or greater
storage of fat in liver) or a greater fat disposition in abdominal adipose
tissue. These changes in metabolic capacity could be used as targets for
individual level prevention or management in those exposed to adversity. We also
intend to publish the analytic methods in a format easily usable by other
researchers, e.g. as an R (statistical programming language) software package,
which we hope will accelerate research in this area further.

### A7. Please provide up to 6 keywords which best summarise your proposed research project:

### A8. Please provide a lay summary of your research project in plain English, stating the aims, scientific rationale, project duration and public health impact (up to 5000 characters or 400 words):


Adverse conditions during early life is known to influence the risk for
metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes (T2D) in adulthood. However, it is largely
unknown which metabolic mechanisms mediate the link between early life adversity
and adult T2D. Which interventions in adulthood are most likely to mitigate T2D
risk in those exposed to adversity is dependent on this knowledge. Studying
early life in sufficient detail is difficult as life course data with adequate
metabolic data must be collected and the appropriate, though complex,
statistical techniques, along with the expertise to use them, is needed for
making valid inferences. Two recent advances now make it possible to research
these topics. The ability to *link* cohort studies that have metabolic data with
national register databases that have information from early to end of life
provides the appropriately detailed life-course data. A recent analytical
approach, called *causal structure learning*, provides the statistical process
for working with this data. My **aims** are to determine how specific early life
conditions affect T2D risk and how the metabolic pathways mediate early life adversity
with higher risk for T2D, and to convert a recent integrative pathway *algorithm*
(NetCoupler), capable of analysing high dimensional -omics data, into a reusable
software package. I will link Denmark's unique national registries with multiple
Danish cohorts, deploy and apply the NetCoupler-algorithm, and collaborate with
national and international groups to achieve these aims. The project's software
output will create a tool for researchers working on similar research topics
while the findings will give insight into how adversity modifies metabolism that
then affects T2D risk. With these insights, more effective public health
strategies can be created for T2D prevention and more precise clinical decisions
can be made for T2D management in those exposed to early life adversity.

### A9. Will the research project result in the generation of any new data fields derived from existing complex datasets, such as imaging, accelerometry, electrocardiographic, linked healthcare data, etc, which might be of significant utility to other researchers: 

### A10. What is the estimated duration of your project, in months? If you consider (because for example the project is one involving the generation of hypotheses) that it would be difficult to set a fixed end point, we are prepared to consider a rolling 3-year period (during which annual updates are required):

2 years..?
