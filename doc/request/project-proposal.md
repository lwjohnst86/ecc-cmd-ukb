### A1. Project title (200 characters):

### A2. Research question(s) and aim(s) (up to 5000 characters or 200 words):

- Early childhood using leg length as a biomarker and:
    - Liver function (fat, inflammation, iron, and general image) using MRI images
    - Distribution of fat using DXA and Impediance measures
    - Markers of kidney function
    - Genetic risk prediction scores

> The majority of applications to UK Biobank are for data only. As such, the first two questions we ask are whether your application involves access to samples or re-contact as this will require some additional information and as is set out in the Access Procedures (our data are not depletable, but our samples and re-contact opportunities are depletable) recontact/sample applications are assessed to a different (more exacting) standard.

Does your project require biological samples?

Does your project require UK Biobank to re-contact participants:

### A3. The background and scientific rationale of the proposed research project in general (up to 5000 characters or 300 words): 

### A4. A brief description of the method(s) to be used (up to 5000 characters or 300 words): 

### A5. The type and size of dataset required (e.g., case-control subset, men only, imaging data only, whole cohort, etc.) (up to 5000 characters or 100 words):

### A6. The expected value of the research (taking into account the public interest requirement) (up to 5000 characters or 100 words): 

### A7. Please provide up to 6 keywords which best summarise your proposed research project:

### A8. Please provide a lay summary of your research project in plain English, stating the aims, scientific rationale, project duration and public health impact (up to 5000 characters or 400 words):

### A9. Will the research project result in the generation of any new data fields derived from existing complex datasets, such as imaging, accelerometry, electrocardiographic, linked healthcare data, etc, which might be of significant utility to other researchers: 

### A10. What is the estimated duration of your project, in months? If you consider (because for example the project is one involving the generation of hypotheses) that it would be difficult to set a fixed end point, we are prepared to consider a rolling 3-year period (during which annual updates are required):

2 years..?

Please note that you are expected to publish (or to make publicly available) your results and return to UK Biobank:

- any important derived variables
- a description of the methods used to generate them
- the underlying syntax/code used to generate the main results of the paper, and
- a short layman's description that summarises your findings.

These should be provided within six months of each publication or within 12 months of the project end date (whichever comes first). We also ask that you send us a copy of your accepted manuscript at least two weeks prior to publication and alert us if there are any ethical or contentious issues surrounding the findings. 

### B. Selection of data-fields

- Blood counts
- Urine assays
- Body size measures
- Abdominal MRI (liver images)
- DXA (region specific bone and body composition)
- Impediance measures
- Early life factors
- Indices of Multiple Deprivation
- Genotype/genes
