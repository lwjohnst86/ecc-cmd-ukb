# Abstract

**Background and aims**: Shorter relative adult leg length (LL), a
marker of adverse growth conditions during early childhood, is
associated with a higher risk for type 2 diabetes. How this link is
mediated metabolically is not well known in humans. Our aim was to
identify how the components of stature influence the metabolic profile
in adults and the consequent risk for type 2 diabetes through higher
HbA1c.

**Materials and methods**: We used 367,838 participants (176,420 men,
191,418 women) from UK Biobank, excluding prevalent diabetes cases. We
applied a causal structure learning algorithm (NetCoupler) to identify
the most likely pathways between an exposure, a metabolic network, and
an outcome. The algorithm: constructs an estimated network for the
metabolic variables; iterates through each variable, linking it to
either the exposure or outcome; and identifies links as potential direct
effects that exist when independent of neighbouring variables in the
network. For this study, we used height, LL, and leg-to-height ratio
(LHR) as the individual exposures and HbA1c as the outcome. The
metabolic variables chosen to form part of the network were:
gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), TG, LDL, HDL, total cholesterol,
C-reactive protein (CRP), apolipoprotein A and B, and albumin. Age, sex,
and waist circumference adjustments were applied in the algorithm.

**Results**: The initial network generated from the metabolic variables
identified links expected between metabolic variables (Figure), such as
between HDL-LDL-Cholesterol-TG (serum lipid profile) and GGT-ALT-AST
(liver function). A darker blue link indicates a positive relationship,
while darker orange indicates a negative relationship. Between the
metabolic network variables and HbA1c there were positive relationships
between ALT, GGT, and CRP. For the stature components, there were
negative relationships between: LHR, LL, and height on TG; LHR, LL on
CRP and ALT; and, LL and height on GGT. There were positive
relationships between: LL on HDL. Based on the NetCoupler algorithm, we
found that LHR, LL, and height were likely causally linked with HbA1c
through GGT, ALT, and CRP.

**Conclusion**: Our findings suggest that overall childhood growth
conditions that result in relatively longer legs and a taller stature
may confer some protection against dysregulation of glucose metabolism
and possibly type 2 diabetes (from higher HbA1c) potentially through
preserved liver function (through GGT and ALT) and through generally
lower inflammation (via CRP).

# Introduction

-   Short adult leg length (LL) is a marker of adverse early childhood
    conditions and is associated with higher risk for type 2 diabetes,
    but it's not known how this association is metabolically mediated.
-   *Aim*: Identify how components of stature influence metabolic
    profile and HbA1c.

using a causal structure learning algorithm to investigate potential
metabolic pathways between the components of stature and HbA1c.

So, there is strong evidence of a relationship between adverse early
life conditions and risk for type 2 diabetes, but it isn't well-studied
in humans how this association may be mediated metabolically. So, using
the UK Biobank Cohort, we studied how adult leg length, used as a marker
of early childhood conditions, may influence type 2 diabetes risk with
HbA1c through a standard metabolic variables.

For this aim, my colleague Clemens developed a statistical method called
NetCoupler that could identify pathways in a metabolic network and
analyze how an exposure may influence this network and how this network
may then influence an outcome. Both myself and Clemens are developing
NetCoupler as an R package for wider use and more details about it are
in the link shown on the poster.

# Research Design and Methods

-   Cross-sectional analysis of UK Biobank (Application ID 47673):
    n=367,838, without prevalent diabetes cases.
-   Applied causal structure learning algorithm NetCoupler (R package at
    [github.com/NetCoupler](https://github.com/NetCoupler/NetCoupler)),
    tested on 100 resamples of 10% of dataset.
-   Exposures: LL, leg-height ratio (LHR), and height; Outcome: HbA1c.
-   Metabolic profile: gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alanine
    aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), TAG,
    LDL-C, HDL-C, total cholesterol, C-reactive protein (CRP),
    apolipoprotein A and B, and albumin.
-   Confounders: Age, sex, and waist circumference.

So, briefly, NetCoupler works in four phases, as shown in Figure 1:
First, it estimates connections between metabolic variables, called
nodes, and constructs a network. Two, it extracts each node iteratively
along with its linked neighbouring nodes. Three, it calculates all
possible combinations of these neighbouring nodes with the index node
and sets each as a model. So with 3 neighbours, that is 8 models. It
then runs each model with the exposure or outcome on the index node,
adjusting for confounders like age, sex, and waist circumference.
Finally, based on the model results, it classifies using some criteria
whether the link is direct, ambiguous, or non-existent.

# Results

-   Metabolic network links: e.g. HDL-C-LDL-C-Cholesterol-TAG (serum
    lipid profile) and GGT-ALT-AST (liver function).

```{r}
# plot_network_results()
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("doc/images/network-results.png"))
```

-   Network to HbA1c: Positive links with ALT, GGT, and CRP.
-   Stature to network: Negative links between:
    -   LL and height on CRP, GGT, and TAG.
    -   LHR, LL on CRP and ALT.
-   NetCoupler algorithm identified GGT, ALT, and CRP as likely
    metabolic link between stature components and HbA1c.

The nice thing about NetCoupler is that the results can be very nicely
represented visually, as shown in figure 2. Each dot is a variable, the
darker blue lines indicate a positive link between nodes, a darker red
is a negative link, and the numbers are the weights between the network
variables.

There's a lot going on, so I'll highlight the top portion, where the
variables HDL, LDL, cholesterol, and TAG which is in the middle are all
strongly linked together, which is as we would expect. Likewise, liver
function variables, at the bottom and middle left, like ALT, AST, and
GGT are all linked.

On the left side are the stature components, including leg to height
ratio, where we identified direct negative links with ALT, GGT, TAG, and
CRP. On the right side with HbA1c, we found direct positive links with
ALT, CRP, and GGT. So from these results, we can infer that lower
stature components, including lower relative leg length, may contribute
to higher HbA1c through higher ALT, CRP, and GGT.

# Discussion

## Strengths

## Limitations

## Conclusions

-   Adverse early childhood growth conditions (leading to shorter legs
    and shorter stature) may contribute to higher HbA1c through higher
    liver dysfunction (GGT and ALT) and higher inflammation (CRP).

To conclude, these results suggest that adverse early childhood
conditions may contribute to risk for type 2 diabetes through higher
liver dysfunction and through higher systemic inflammation. Thank you
for listening and I look forward to any questions.

Grey lines between metabolic variables are the derived neighbours, but with weaker connections. Numbers between metabolic variables indicate the weights for the strong links (a larger number suggests a stronger link). Links shown with the stature or HbA1c variables and the network variables were classified as direct effect links; while all other connections with metabolic variables had been classified as ambiguous, they were removed for better visual presentation."
